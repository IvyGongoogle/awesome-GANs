A curated list of awesome Generative Adversarial Networks papers, experiments, libraries, and projects.

## What is GANs?

**Generative adversarial networks** are a branch of unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.



> There are many interesting recent development in deep learning... The most important one, in my opinion, is adversarial training (also called GAN for Generative Adversarial Networks). This, and the variations that are now being proposed is the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML, in my opinion.
